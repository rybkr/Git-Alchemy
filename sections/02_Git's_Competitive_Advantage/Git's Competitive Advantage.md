# Git's Competitive Advantage

In the spring of 2005, Linus Torvalds found himself facing an unexpected crisis.
The Linux kernel project, which had grown from his personal experiment into a global collaboration with thousands of developers, was suddenly without its version control system.
BitKeeper, the proprietary tool that managed the kernel's development for three years, was no longer available to the open-source community after a licensing dispute.
With characteristic pragmatism and impatience, Torvalds surveyed alternatives like CVS and Subversion and found them all lacking.
They were too slow, too centralized, or simply inadequate for the scale and distributed nature of the Linux kernel development.

Rather than compromise or wait for someone else to solve the problem, Torvalds began a two-week coding sprint that produced the initial version of Git.
Drawing on his experience with BitKeeper's distributed model but rejecting its complexity, he designed a system that was blindingly fast, fully distributed, and robust enough for the kernel's sprawling development.
By April 2005, Git was managing its own source code. Within months, it proved capable of handling one of the world's most complex software projects, setting the stage for its eventual dominance in version control.

## What You'll Learn

This guide explores the architectural decisions that give Git its competitive advantages.
By the end, you'll understand:

- How Git's snapshot-based model differs fundamentally from traditional delta-based VCSs

- How Git's three-state architecture enables flexible and powerful workflows

- Why cryptographic hashing makes Git more reliable than its predecessors.

- The trade-offs made to achieve Git's exceptional performance.

## Git's Design Philosophy

When Torvalds set out to build Git, he wasn't simply creating another version control system.
He was solving specific problems that had frustrated him during Linux kernel development; problems that existing tools failed to address.

Git's design reflects core priorities that distinguish it from competitors:

1. **Speed at scale:**
The Linux kernel repository contained thousands of files and years of history.
Git needed to handle commits, branches, and merges in seconds, not minutes.
This requirement influenced every architectural decision, from how Git stores data to how it tracks changes.

2. **Distributed integrity:**
With thousands of developers worldwide contributing code, Git required assurances that repository history could not be corrupted or tampered with, either accidentally or maliciously.
Every object in Git is checksummed, making it nearly impossible to change any file, date, or commit message without Git detecting it.

3. **Non-linear development:**
Kernel development involved creating, modifying, and daily merging of hundreds of experimental branches.
Git needed to make branching and merging lightweight and reliable so developers would not hesitate to create branches for minor experiments.

These priorities led to architectural choices that set Git apart from its predecessors and distributed contemporaries.

### Thinking in Snapshots

The most fundamental distinction between Git and most other VCSs lies in how it conceptualizes data.
Most systems, including CVS, Subversion, and Perforce, store information as a list of file changes.
They maintain a base version of each file, then record the differences (deltas) between versions. This is known as *delta-based* version control.

When you want version 5 of a file, the system starts with the base version and applies delta 1, then delta 2, then delta 3, and so on until it reconstructs the version you requested.
This approach mirrors how we think about file modifications and can be space-efficient for certain workflows, especially when files undergo frequent small changes.

Git rejects this model entirely.
Instead of storing deltas, Git takes a complete snapshot of your project at each version.
When you commit a version, Git captures a snapshot of what every file in your project looks like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.
This means Git views its data as a series of snapshots, rather than a series of incremental changes.

This architectural decision has profound implications for performance and workflow.
When you checkout a previous version of your project, Git doesn't need to reconstruct it by walking through a chain of deltas.
It simply retrieves the snapshot directly.
This enables operations such as switching branches, viewing history, or comparing versions to be performed extraordinarily fast.
Even in repositories with thousands of files and years of history, these operations typically complete in milliseconds.

### Built-in Integrity

Every piece of data in Git is checksummed before it is stored and then referred to by that checksum.
This means it's impossible to change the contents of any file or directory in a Git project without Git being aware of it.
This isn't a feature you enable or a setting you configure; it's fundamental to how Git stores and references data.

The mechanism Git uses for checksumming is called [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) (Secure Hash Algorithm 1).
This hash function takes any input, a file, a directory structure, or a commit object, and produces a 40-character hexadecimal string composed of the digits `0-9` and letters `a-f`.
The crucial property of this hash is that it's deterministic: the same input always produces the same hash, but even the tiniest change to the input produces a completely different hash.

For example, the hash for the current commit of the directory holding these lecture notes is:

```
273b1294419ffbce11002241aff9d0839eb1172c
```

And even though I've only added (this) one sentence, now the hash is:

```
12a78e5086ae51ed0be88bfa3b3ebd1bd5c88d38
```

This string isn't random or arbitrarily assigned.
It's a mathematical fingerprint of the exact contents of that commit: the files it contains, the commit message, the author information, the timestamp, and the hash of its parent commit.
Change any single character in any file, alter the commit message by one letter, or modify the timestamp by one second, and you'll get an entirely different hash.

## The Three File States

Intuitively, one would expect a version control system to manage files in two states: **modified** or **unmodified**.
Upon committing, the system would mark the changes and call every file unmodified.
Git, on the other hand, introduces an intermediate stage that enables more fine-grained control over commits and workflow. The three distinct states are:

1. **Modified:** You've changed a file but haven't yet told Git to record that change.

2. **Staged:** You've marked a file in its current state to go into your next snapshot. This is the intermediate stage.

3. **Committed:** The data is stored in your local Git repository. This is equivalent to an "unmodified" state.
