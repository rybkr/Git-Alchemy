<blockquote>
<p>“Git isn’t just a version control system; it’s a framework of trust.
A record of vision. A space where every branch reflects thought, and
every commit carries intent.” <em>—Mohamed Yasser</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the spring of 2005, Linus Torvalds found himself facing an
unexpected crisis. The Linux kernel project, which had grown from his
personal experiment into a global collaboration involving thousands of
developers, was suddenly without its version control system. BitKeeper,
the proprietary tool that had managed the kernel’s development for three
years, was no longer available to the open-source community after a
licensing dispute. With characteristic pragmatism and a touch of
impatience, Torvalds surveyed the existing alternatives, such as CVS,
Subversion, and found them all lacking. They were too slow, too
centralized, or simply inadequate for the scale and distributed nature
of the Linux kernel development.</p>
<p>Rather than compromise or wait for someone else to solve the problem,
Torvalds embarked on a two-week coding sprint that would produce the
initial version of Git. Drawing inspiration from his experience with
BitKeeper’s distributed model while rejecting its complexity, he
designed a system that was blindingly fast, completely distributed, and
robust enough to handle the kernel’s sprawling development process. By
April 2005, Git was managing its own source code, and within months it
had proven itself capable of handling one of the world’s most complex
software projects, setting the stage for its eventual dominance in the
version control landscape.</p>
