# Git's Competitive Advantage

In the spring of 2005, Linus Torvalds found himself facing an unexpected crisis.
The Linux kernel project, which had grown from his personal experiment into a global collaboration involving thousands of developers, was suddenly without its version control system.
BitKeeper, the proprietary tool that had managed the kernel's development for three years, was no longer available to the open-source community after a licensing dispute.
With characteristic pragmatism and a touch of impatience, Torvalds surveyed the existing alternatives, such as CVS, Subversion, and found them all lacking.
They were too slow, too centralized, or simply inadequate for the scale and distributed nature of the Linux kernel development.

Rather than compromise or wait for someone else to solve the problem, Torvalds embarked on a two-week coding sprint that would produce the initial version of Git.
Drawing inspiration from his experience with BitKeeper's distributed model while rejecting its complexity, he designed a system that was blindingly fast, completely distributed, and robust enough to handle the kernel's sprawling development process.
By April 2005, Git was managing its own source code, and within months it had proven itself capable of handling one of the world's most complex software projects, setting the stage for its eventual dominance in the version control landscape.
